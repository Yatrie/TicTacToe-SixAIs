# Tic Tac Toe - An implementation of Six AI Player Models

Implementation of six different Artificial Intelligences representing the mental models for: a Kindergartner, First Grader, Third Grader, and three Adults with one being Expert player.

AIs Modeled based on strategies defined in: Crowley, K., &amp; Siegler, R. S. (1993). Flexible strategy use in young children's Tic Tac Toe. Cognitive Science, 17(4), 531561.

# Usage

Step 1: Install Tkinter (for Python2) if not already present: https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html

Step 2: Invoke Play_Tic_Tac_Toe.py in Python2

Step 3: Enjoy the 14 game tournament! You get one chance to play each AI model twice, once when AI starts the game and once when you do. There is an element of surprise with one matchup based randomly on one of the six AI models. The play order is also randomized to keep things interesting.

Step 4: Remember to keep track of what you percive as the playing ability level of your AI opponent. Check the results file to compare your analysis with the actual experiment!
